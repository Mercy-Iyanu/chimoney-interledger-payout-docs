# Chimoney Interledger Wallet Address Payout Documentation

This project is my submission to the **WriteTech Hub x Chimoney API Documentation Challenge**.

It covers documentation for the `payouts/interledger-wallet-address` endpoint from Chimoney's API.

## 📄 Deliverables

- [`setup.md`](./setup.md) – A developer setup guide for authenticating and testing the payout endpoint
- [`tutorial.md`](./tutorial.md) – A tutorial showing how to integrate the endpoint into a codebase
- [`use-case.md`](./use-case.md) – A real-world use case scenario: sending cross-border payments to ILP addresses

## 🧠 Tech & Skills Highlighted

- API documentation writing
- RESTful API integration
- Developer experience (DX) best practices
- Chimoney API, Interledger Protocol (ILP)
- Markdown formatting & Git collaboration

## 🌍 Context

This was written as part of a competitive technical writing challenge. The goal was to create beginner-friendly, accurate, and helpful API docs based on a real Chimoney endpoint.

## 🌱 What I Learned

Participating in this challenge helped me improve not just my technical writing, but also my ability to:

- **Write developer-first documentation** that's clear, casual, and genuinely useful  
- **Anticipate and solve common integration problems** by debugging real API calls  
- **Explain technical concepts** like Interledger and payment pointers in beginner-friendly language  
- **Work with API reference docs and Swagger explorers** as a user would

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a frontend engineer passionate about building developer tools and writing helpful, no-fluff technical content.  
Currently exploring **green software**, **developer experience (DX)**, and **API design**.
